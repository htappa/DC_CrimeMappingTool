# DC Crime Mapping Tool

### Description
Washington, DC has a historically high crime rate, and while crime as a whole has been on a downward trend for some time, there are still over 30,000 documented crimes that occur every year, and this project explores these crime incidents. The goal is to create a user-friendly, easy-to-use mapping tool that will display all 2019 crimes on an interactive map of DC, filtered by time of day, and by category of crime. The purpose of this tool is to give the average user the information they need to quickly make an informed decision on their level of safety in different parts of the city. The repository contains two files:
- mapping_tool.py: Mapping tool that displays 2019 crimes.
- dc_crimes_analysis.ipynb: An analysis of the crime data for 2015-2019.
